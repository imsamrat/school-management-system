## 🎯 Integration in Admin Dashboard

The components are now integrated in the **Fees Section** with tab navigation:

```
Admin Dashboard > Fees
├── Overview (Stats Cards)
├── Tab 1: Fee Structures
├── Tab 2: Payment Collections
└── Tab 3: Dues Management
```

**File**: `src/app/admin/fees/page.tsx`

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Backend Setup)

To make the system fully functional, run these commands:

### Step 1: Regenerate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This will generate the Prisma client with the new fee management models.

### Step 2: Push Database Schema

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This creates the tables in your database.

### Step 3: Seed Default Fee Types

```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-fee-types.ts
```

This populates:

- 12 default fee types (Tuition, Admission, Exam, Library, Lab, Sports, etc.)
- Sample fee structures for existing classes

### Step 4: Test the System

1. Open admin dashboard: `/admin/fees`
2. Navigate to "Fee Structures" tab
3. Create fee structures for your classes
4. Assign fees to students (bulk or individual)
5. Go to "Payment Collections" tab
6. Record payments with discounts if needed
7. Check "Dues Management" tab for tracking

## 📝 Database Schema Reminder

The system uses 5 interconnected models:

```
FeeType → FeeStructure → StudentFee → Payment
                              ↓
                        MonthlyDue
```

**Key Relations**:

- `FeeType`: Defines fee categories (Tuition, Admission, etc.)
- `FeeStructure`: Class-specific fee amounts
- `StudentFee`: Individual student fee assignments
- `Payment`: Transaction records
- `MonthlyDue`: Month-wise tracking for recurring fees
